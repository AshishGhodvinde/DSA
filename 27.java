}


//k will keep track of elemnts that can be replaced(for eg. if i is somewhere ahead and k will be at back where it will be at nums[i]==val then when i will found element diff than val it will be replaced by nums[k])
// k will be slow and i will go ahead in search of elements other than val
//initially i and k will be equal till i encounters val ,when that happens only i will be incremented
